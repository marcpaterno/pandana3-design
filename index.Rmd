# Preface {-}

This design document is current a work in progress.
The design of PandAna 3 is not yet complete;
in fact, it is far from complete.
It will be continually updated as our understanding of what is needed by the
experimenters is needed.

This work is being done as part of the
[SciDAC](https://www.scidac.gov/partnerships/high-energy-physics.html) project 
[HEP analytics on HPC](https://computing.fnal.gov/hep-on-hpc).
